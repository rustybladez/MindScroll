# MindScroll Icons

This directory contains the extension icons. For now, you'll need to create the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels) - For the extension toolbar
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) - For the extensions management page
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels) - For the Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design Suggestions:

- Use a brain emoji (ðŸ§ ) or brain icon
- Include a scroll or timer element
- Use colors that stand out: blue (#4267B2) and orange/red for warnings
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Creating Icons:

You can use any image editor like:

- Figma (free, web-based)
- Canva (free, web-based)
- Photoshop/GIMP
- Even just taking screenshots of emoji and resizing

## Temporary Solution:

The extension will work without custom icons, Chrome will use default placeholder icons.
